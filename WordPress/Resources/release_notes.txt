New! Username @mentions now auto-complete in the Block Editor for WordPress.com and Jetpack sites. Type the “@” character to see a pop-up displaying usernames and make your selection! In this version, we’ve added support for media editing in the Cover block and fixed a Heading block bug where a heading with a link and string formatting displayed a white shadow in dark mode. Lastly, site headings in the WordPress.com Reader now have a modern new look.
